README

This is Tk::Splash, a perl/Tk module for creating splash screens.
There is nothing special about Tk::Splash (it's just a toplevel with
an embedded image), as it is only here for compatibility issues.
However, the companion module, Tk::FastSplash, uses some internal
perl/Tk magic to create the splash screen as fast as possible.

Tk::Splash should work with older (402.*) and newer (800.* and
804.025) Tk's. Tk::FastSplash will only work with newer Tk's (800.*
and upwards), but future compatibility cannot be assured :-)

Tk::ProgressSplash is a splash window with a progress bar.
